This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Dev troubleshooting

`npm run dev` runs a **predev** check that clears a stale `.next/dev` cache when routes (for example `/about`) are missing from Turbopack’s route manifest. That prevents 404s after adding pages or when the cache is corrupted on slow/network drives.

If issues persist, use a full clean start:

```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

Homepage sections live under `app/(site)/`. Internal pages (About, Contact, Services, Projects) are under `app/(site)/about` and `app/(site)/(internal)/`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
